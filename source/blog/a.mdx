I was listening to the most recent Vergecast episode last night and an interview with Josh Miller, CEO of The Browser Company, makers of the ARC Browser and the new ARC Search app. I found the whole interview baffling.

Josh is rightfully complaining about the state of the web, specifically the mobile web, but the solution he’s proposing is so stupidly naive that I’m not entirely sure whether he’s just fucking with us.

His whole point is that search engines are not the best way to surface information. You search for something, you’re presented with a list of links, and you have to click through them and actively look for the thing you were searching for. The proposed solution is AI—who would have thought—that essentially googles for you, “reads” a bunch of the links, and then creates a summary page.

All this is obviously done by stripping away all the tracking and ads that are part of today’s web.
